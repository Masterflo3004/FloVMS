# FloVMS
This is a small private prject I built. This project contains a small compiler for a small assembly language, and a VM to run the compiled files.
**How to run**
Just compile and run the compiler file and Input the relative path to the file you want to compile. This generates a file called "filename".s.bin  .
Now you can execute main.c and provide the generated file to run it.

**Project Structure**
main.c = The Code of the VM to execute the generated .bin files
compiler.bin = compiles .s files to .bin files
guide.md = a small guide explaining the available commands
LICENSE.md = the MIT License
examples/count.s = a example project, just counting and printing the values


**Disclaimer**
